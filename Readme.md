Welcome to Chronos(re)Venger!
=============================

This project is orginally based on [this one](https://github.com/igormages/ChronosVenger), but rewritten in Django.

It also brings the possibility to blacklist courses, have a smarter cache handling (to relieve [3IE](https://www.3ie.fr)'s servers), and overall better performances.

The site is live at [chronosvenger.me](https://chronosvenger.me)

Feel free to contribute via a PR! I'll be happy to review.
